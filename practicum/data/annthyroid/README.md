# Thyroid Disease Dataset

## Dataset information

The original thyroid disease (ann-thyroid) dataset from UCI machine learning repository is a classification dataset, which is suited for training ANNs. It has 3772 training instances and 3428 testing instances. It has 15 categorical and 6 real attributes. The problem is to determine whether a patient referred to the clinic is hypothyroid. Therefore three classes are built: normal (not hypothyroid), hyperfunction and subnormal functioning. For outlier detection, both training and testing instances are used, with only 6 real attributes. The hyperfunction and subnormal classes are treated as outlier class and the other one as inliers class.
